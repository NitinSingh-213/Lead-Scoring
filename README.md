# Lead-Scoring
## A case study on how to score leads based on their conversion probability
Leads are potential customers that a business/company has access to. The goal of the company is to get the leads to convert to customers.
To contact all potential leads would require more time, energy, money and other resources than is required.
This is where models like this one helps. This is catered to the specific needs of an Ed-Tech company. 
The goal was to assign a score to all leads which is tied to the probability that they will buy the courses.
This allows the company to go after 'hot leads' i.e. customers most likely to convert, and maximize profit.
